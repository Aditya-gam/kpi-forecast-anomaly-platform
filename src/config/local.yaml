# config/local.yaml
#
# Configuration file for the local development environment.
#
# This file contains parameters and paths specific to your local setup,
# including local endpoints (e.g., LocalStack for AWS S3), file system paths,
# model hyperparameters for rapid iteration, and detailed logging.
#
# IMPORTANT: For credentials, use environment variables or secrets management
#          instead of hardcoding in production. These values here are for
#          development/testing only.
